    "# Assignment - Implementing graph algorithms with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of Course 1 in the Generative AI for Software Development Specialization! In this assignment you will **work alongside an LLM to take on four different graph-based problems** including finding the shortest path through a graph and solving different variations of the classic Travelling Salesman Problem in which you must find the shortest tour through every vertex in the graph. This is a great opportunity to practice using the LLM skills you've been learning! You can use the LLM of your choosing but [GPT-4o is available here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/ungradedLab/Vuqvf/gpt-3-5-environment), in the ungraded lab that accompanies this assignment.\n",

    "## 1 - Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment revolves around a pre-implemented `Graph` class. You will implement four additional classes, each focused on specific graph-related problems:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **GraphShortestPath** – Implements the `shortest_path` method to find the shortest route between two nodes.  \n",
    "- **GraphTSPSmallGraph** – Implements the `tsp_small_graph` method to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) efficiently for small graphs.  \n",
    "- **GraphTSPMediumGraph** – Implements the `tsp_medium_graph` method to solve TSP for medium-sized graphs.  \n",
    "- **GraphTSPLargeGraph** – Implements the `tsp_large_graph` method to tackle TSP for large graphs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each task comes with constraints and execution time limits, detailed in their respective sections. Work alongside an LLM to develop these algorithms, but avoid copying solutions outright. Instead, ask for explanations, break down the logic, and refine your approach. This will help with debugging and optimizing the code to meet the assignment's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a few important points on how this notebook works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Only the graded cells are Graded:** You can add new cells to experiment but these will be ignored by the grader. If you want something graded, include it in the provided cell that contains the respective Graph class.\n",
    "- **Some cells are frozen:** Some cells are frozen, e.g. the `Graph` class, to avoid mistakenly editing their code.\n",
    "- **Avoid importing new libraries:** Avoid importing new libraries beyond those you'll find in section 1.1, immediately below. **In particular `joblib` or any multiprocessing or parallel computing approach will crash the grader.\n",
    "- **Save before submitting:** Do this to ensure you are graded on your most recent work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you experience any issues with the assignment or have any difficulties, please reach out to our [Discourse Community](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/item/hIZen). Mentors, fellow learners, and staff will be available to assist you with any challenges you may encounter!**\n",

    "- **Understand the Problem**: Discuss graph theory problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and shortest path finding with the LLM. Use it to clarify concepts and get examples, enhancing your foundational knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze the `Graph` Class**: Analyze the provided Graph class functions and structure by consulting the LLM. Its explanations will help you understand how to effectively utilize and extend the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brainstorm Solutions**: For each exercise, there is a class and a method (`shortest_path`, `tsp_small_graph`, `tsp_large_graph`, `tsp_medium_graph`), brainstorm with the LLM potential solutions. Share the time constraints and whether the solutions need to be optimal and see which algorithms the LLM recommends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implement Solutions**: Have the LLM generate methods that implement the solutions you brainstorm. Ensure the LLM understands the structure of the `Graph` class and the function you want to implement so that the generated code will run as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Debug Errors**: Use the LLM to strategize and review your testing approach, especially for tests that yield unexpected results. It can offer debugging and optimization advice to improve your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the LLM Best Practices of \"Be specific\", \"Assign a role\", \"Request an expert opinion\", \"Give feedback\" should serve you well throughout!"

    "### Exercise 4: `tsp_medium_graph` (Complete Graphs, 300 nodes, Near-Optimal Solution, 1.5 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last version of the Traveling Salesman Problem, you will need to work with an LLM to develop a solution that improves upon the algorithm you used in Exercise 3. Now you will be given complete graphs of about 300 nodes. The time requirement has been relaxed to `1.5` seconds, giving your algorithm 3 times as long to run. The tour length requirements, however, have been tightened, meaning you'll need to find tours that are much closer to the theoretical optimum. This likely means that the heuristic you used in Exercise 3 will no longer produce short enough tours. Brainstorm with your LLM new heuristics you could implement that take advantage of the longer runtime you're allowed and generate relatively shorter tours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read **carefully** the function's docstring (the text describing the function), as the parameters and the return must **NOT** be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:** Do **NOT** include any new libraries beyond those imported at the beginning of the notebook. You may need to explicitly state this and ask the LLM **NOT** to use any additional libraries if necessary. Using additional libraries may cause you to fail the autograder, even if you pass the local tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you CAN do:** Create new functions **within the `GraphTSPMediumGraph` class**. Do **NOT** create functions outside the `GraphTSPMediumGraph` class or outside this graded cell. You may do so during development, but in the end, paste your solution into the graded cell following these instructions."

Therefore, if you include any additional content (such as print statements) outside the functions in the graded cells, it might disrupt the autograder's process. This discrepancy could be why you might pass all the unit tests but still encounter issues with the autograder.\n",
