Contains exercises from Generative AI for Software Development Skill Certificate course

In this Skill Certificate from DeepLearning.ai, you’ll learn from Laurence Moroney, former AI lead at Google, as he guides you through a comprehensive pathway to understand and apply generative AI technologies in real-world software development.  

Learn practical prompt engineering and pair programming with LLMs like ChatGPT to enhance your software development workflow. Through hands-on projects, you'll gain techniques for using AI to help with common development tasks - from writing and testing code to creating documentation and managing dependencies. This program teaches you how to effectively prompt LLMs to assist with everything from basic coding tasks to implementing complex design patterns and database architectures. 

As AI-powered coding tools are set to transform the industry, with Gartner predicting 70% adoption by platform engineering teams by 2027, this course will support you in learning these technologies at all stages of your career. It will show you how to use LLMs to leverage your own experience and knowledge to become a faster, more productive worker. You will be introduced to a new paradigm for software development, where LLMs become invaluable members of your development team by acting as pair coding partners, software testers, security experts, and knowledgeable colleagues.

Applied Learning Project
- Pair-coding with an LLM to efficiently modify data structures for use in production and at big data scales
- Work with an LLM as a skilled software tester to identify bugs, create edge case tests, and update code to correct errors
- Implement a functioning local database from scratch, and partner with an LLM to think through software design issues and how to optimize for efficient, secure data access. 

## Course 1: Introduction to Generative AI for Software Development
- Integrate generative AI in development. Learn to use generative AI tools from initial design to deployment, enhancing your efficiency and creativity.
- Optimize your code quality. Improve your coding, if you’re just starting and need help fixing bugs or an experienced developer breaking new ground.
- Experiment quickly. Using LLMs can speed up your ability to prototype and test new features, allowing you to quickly iterate and ship your code.
- Learn how LLMs work. By knowing how machine learning systems work, you’ll be able to use them more effectively to support your work as a developer.

## Course 2: Team Software Engineering with AI
- Leverage LLMs to enhance team collaboration in software development projects.
- Use AI to generate comprehensive tests and clear documentation for your code.
- Manage and debug complex software dependencies with AI assistance.

## Course 3: AI-Powered Software and System Design
- Design and implement software architectures guided by AI insights  
- Create and optimize databases from scratch using LLM-assisted techniques  
- Apply advanced design patterns to improve code quality and maintainability
