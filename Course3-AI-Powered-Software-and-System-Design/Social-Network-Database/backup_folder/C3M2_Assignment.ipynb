    "## Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module you've been learning how LLMs can help with many common tasks when working with databases. In this assignment you'll have an opportunity to put those skills into practice. You will be working with a database designed to represent a simple social network. Here's the tasks you'll need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code that reads data from a provided CSV file into the database\n",
    "2. Develop functions that query the database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission and Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will be graded based on four functions that you write. You can find starter code for all four functions below. Unit tests are provided to help you test your work.\n",

    "### Working with the LLM:\n",

    "- **GPT-4o is available:** You can use whichever LLM you prefer on this assignment, but [GPT-4o has been made avaiable](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-powered-software-and-system-design/ungradedLab/rSPHu/gpt-4o-environment-for-assignment-to-use-alongside-the-programming-assignment) in the ungraded lab that follows this assignment\n",
    "- **Provide Context to Your LLM:** The LLM will need the context of the problem you're working on and the code already available to you in order to help develop solutions.\n",
    "- **Work Iteratively and Test as You Go:** Remember, the LLM's advice might not always be spot-on. It's up to you to decide what's useful, test the code it provides, and iterate as you work towards a solution."

    "\n",
    "The database defined in the `create_database` function does not yet contain any data. You'll need to write the code for the `load_data_from_csv` function below to populate the database. To do that, you'll use the `members.csv` file which is available in this lab in the same directory as this notebook. The data is stored in a single table with one row for each person. The Friendships column contains the IDs of everyone the person in that row considers a friend. The Clubs column contains the names of each club the person in that row is a part of.\n",

    "\n",
    "**HINTS**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remember** that you should avoid blindly pasting LLM code into your solution. If a code doesn't run, try looking at the exception and understand what might be going on, then you can pass more information to the LLM.\n",
    "- **Remember** to also pass the `create_database()` function so the LLM can understand the database structure.\n",
    "- **Remember** to pass the necessary information about the `members.csv` structure. You can see it by clicking on the `members.csv` file in the right panel. **Pass the correct information to the LLM regarding the columns,** **remember to mention that the Friends column is a list of integers corresponding to the friends' ID and the Clubs column is a list of strings corresponding to the clubs the member is in.**\n",
    "- **Pass** the function `load_data_from_csv` and ask it to complete.\n",
    "- **Remember** that the solution must be placed in the cell that is designated for it (the one below here). You may create new cells to test if you want to, but **remember** to paste your solution in the initial graded cell. Do **NOT** delete it, as it is tagged and the autograder will look for the specific tag, deleting it will make the autograder unable to find your solution."

    "Your submission will be evaluated by an automated grading system, known as an autograder. This system automatically reviews your notebook and assigns a grade based on specific criteria. It's important to note that the autograder will only evaluate the cells marked for grading and will not consider the content of the entire notebook. Therefore, if you include any additional content (such as print statements) outside the functions in the graded cells, it might disrupt the autograder's process. This discrepancy could be why you might pass all the unit tests but still encounter issues with the autograder.\n",

    "To avoid such problems, please execute the following cell before submitting. This step will check for consistency within the graded cells but will not evaluate the correctness of your solutions—that aspect is determined by the unit tests. If the consistency check uncovers any issues, you'll have the opportunity to review and adjust your code accordingly.\n",
